# WARD - Alias Management System

WARD is an identity management system for creating and managing digital aliases. It provides a comprehensive solution for generating complete identity profiles, including AI-generated photos, secure password storage, and 2FA authentication code generation, all with a focus on privacy and security.

> **Important**: Never share your encryption password with anyone. If you lose your password, you will not be able to decrypt your data.

## Usage

* **Create an Alias**: Click the `+` button in the tab bar to generate a new identity. You can regenerate the details until you are satisfied and then select a username to create the alias.
* **Generate Profile Photo**: Once an alias is created, you can generate an AI-powered profile photo. You can keep generating new photos until you find one you like, then "lock" it to save.
* **Manage Passwords**: Add, view, copy, and delete passwords associated with an alias. A password generator is included for creating strong, random passwords.
* **Manage 2FA**: Add services and their secret keys to generate TOTP codes.
* **Import/Export**: Use the "Import" and "Export" buttons to load and save your encrypted alias data. **It is highly recommended to export your data regularly as a backup.**
